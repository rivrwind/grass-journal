      <title>Coronajournal - Cats &amp; Car Maintenance</title>

      <description>I have been doing pushups lately. But my schedule is erratic. I rarely know when I will do a pushup. Sometimes I do them in the morning before I take my dogbone loop run through the dry neighborhoods. Sometimes at night just before bed. There are lots of times when I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do them, but I do them anyway.
As I write now I can hear birds outside in the chamisa, which is also called rabbitbrush.</description>

      <description>Last night I washed the dishes left over from lunch. I washed them quickly at first, since washing dishes is such a boring task that has to be done every day. Long ago, it seems, I had determined that a chore like washing dishes held no real value, except in the clean dishes maybe‚Äîbut in the act, the act of washing dishes there was nothing valuable.
To wash the dishes I turned on the water until it was warm.</description>

Let me tell you
a story ‚Äî
It was
spring
They
two of Them
Moved through the mountains
as the snow left behind
wet rocks, trickles of
water
and cold mud‚Äî
Moved through the mountains, from low
to high, two of them
through the cold mud
and over drying rocks.
They had with them
red willow stems
from lower down
and larch boughs that they cut to sleep on.</description>

      <description>About ten years ago I carried a camera with me wherever I went. It was mostly film rangefinders back then‚ÄîLeicas, Bronicas, Olympus XAs, a Zeiss or two‚Äîand I had the film developed. And I scanned it myself. I posted the photos to Flickr. I had thousands of photos there. I switched to DSLRS after a while, then back and forth, then went digital for good when film developing started to get ever more expensive.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúIt is difficult to get the news from poems
yet men die miserably every day
for lack of what is found there.‚Äù
 ‚Äî William Carlos Williams
I remember wandering in the woods in Maine, not long ago, and I saw a tree stump. And I thought, how worthless this stump. The tree has died, and there is nothing left but a jagged place, taking up space. And yet, as we know now, trees, for some reason, keep other trees alive long after death.</description>

      <description>I have thought about starting a podcast for years. But the ideas never congealed. Just recently, though, I came to an idea that has some momentum. Over the last year I wrote a book called A Body of Water. The podcast will be about publishing this book.
The book itself is a loosely connected narrative of poems about my search for home over about four years time. It also has themes of impermanence, interbeing, and ecology.</description>

      <title>Why I Share</title>

      <description>After deleting my Instagram account, I have been thinking a lot about sharing.
When I was growing up, sharing was partly learned. It felt hard at first. It usually meant giving away something that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get back. It meant a comittment of a resource to some person or purpose. Like a juicebox at lunch, or a seat at a table.
However, once a person learns to share, it feels good.</description>

      <description>Close the eyes, and slip in
to that dark space.
A moment, then none.
No time.
I cannot explain.
Deep
in the pine woods
the water running by logs
and rafts
of flowers.
I come back, then go again.
A breath, or maybe more time passes.
In the dark: wavy changy patterns, like the bark
of Ponderosa.
The old trees dance so slow.
And the moons soft glow.
I can&amp;rsquo;t even see, anymore:</description>

      <description>Things have been rough lately, or longly, for about two years now. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I wrote much about it, keeping difficulty to myself here and there, not wanting to bring anyone down, but now that I can see some kind of end, or at least some kind of change, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a few things down.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, over the last four or so years Anna and I have been mostly living in remote places, far away from friends, community, and support.</description>

      <description>For many, this is where the story of their life begins.
In such a room, when they had few things, life was charted to become larger, to include more. Maybe, though, there was a part of Steve Jobs that wished he had never left that room.
For me, this is where life begins, but also where it ends. I have thought carefully about what I want, and tried things. There is something so beautiful in this empty room to me.</description>

      <description>On the corner of Cerillos and Don Diego I saw a man working on his car as I crossed the street. He had the hood up and was talking with a friend. &amp;ldquo;Is that a carbeurator?&amp;rdquo; I asked as I walked up. &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s a carbeurator. Got the original clutch in it too man, like a hundred fifty thousand on it.&amp;rdquo; We talked about how much easier it was to work on carbuerated cars rather than fuel injection.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something funny‚Äî
So many times I&amp;rsquo;ve been told I can&amp;rsquo;t do what I want to do, by so many people, in so many ways. It happens almost every day. And then you might think to yourself, &amp;ldquo;well, I guess this guy is just really selfish, self-centered, and ignorant.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s not true either though, because I do listen: to how plants grow, to how animals live, to how people care and support one another.</description>

      <description>I started writing this out as a short post for Instagram.
I decided to put it there &amp;amp; here, because I wanted to write a little more about each point.
 Ideas For Ethical Instagram Use 1. Consider why you are posting before you post 2. Do not attempt to make your life look enviable, or better than it is For some reason, this is almost the reason Instagram exists. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a harmful practice, and creates competition and instead of collaboration.</description>

      <description>A long time ago I wrote every day for a year. That blog was called Slow Gospel.
Slow Gospel offered a space where people could slow down, even for a moment.
The entries were brief, not longer than 500 words.
That was back in 2012. Things were already humming along pretty quickly back then in the big old world.
After a year I took the site down. It did not gain an audience as I hoped it would.</description>

      <description>Photo above by Demetria Provatas, me above the Hudson River in New York
I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that I feel my work over the last year, and maybe longer, has been dark. It&amp;rsquo;s been some dark times lately, for many people. And my own individual suffering was increased by a series of mistakes I made that resulted in an abusive situation I had a difficult time extracting myself from.
I&amp;rsquo;m not asking anyone to listen to the difficulties, as I have had several willing and loving friends and family members to listen.</description>

Watching Firstly, a new channel by the Criterion Collection. If you&amp;rsquo;re not already an obscure film junky, you could easily become one. Before now, Criterion Collection films were only available on clunky, archaic DVD discs.</description>

      <description>In the last seven years, permit applications for entry into a certain wilderness region in Washington have risen dramatically. In 2011 about 2,800 applications were received. But in 2018 the entries had increased to over 21,500. A similar trend has occurred in other wilderness areas across the USA. Suddenly, the amount of people going to very particular, even remote places, has exploded.
There are probably many reasons why this has happened‚Äîthere is a positive trend of people getting outdoors more.</description>

and I watched as a little bird flew in. Spring rises
like a green mist, up from the ground.

like spring does.
Always something coming back from something
the beat of a stone, two thumps‚Äî

      <description>About twelve years ago, when I was 18, I wound up in college. I remember lots of things from those times, but I often remember hearing how awkward everything was. Maybe it was a buzzword back in those years. I just remember the word being appended to almost every sentence any of my peers uttered. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t that awkward,&amp;rdquo; they would say, about having to talk to a teacher after class. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s so awkward,&amp;rdquo; about a student whose voice cracked when asking a question.</description>

Squeeze the lemon juice into a glass, add the leaves, and pour the water over. I‚Äôm not fully convinced about the idea of alkalizing the body through diet, however I feel like a sour drink early in the morning can relieve sugar cravings, and also improve digestion through stimulating the gallbladder.</description>

      <description>The whole problem of existence
is that we are are like a river, but not
minds always flowing
restless, unable to stop.
Sit
by a river
with me.
See how the water
moves.
Touches
one thing, goes on.
Rest
in a deep pool, behind a log.
It‚Äôs cold, this water.
It will wake you up.
This river is you, and me.
The water is your mind.</description>

And she replied almost greedily, gasping for breath: &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;‚Äî and burst into a storm of weeping.
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; he asked.
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; she wept in despair.
&amp;ldquo;You needn&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of telling me, Sola dear. Maybe I can get it for you when I grow up.&amp;quot;

      <description>After leaving the retreat, I headed west and then south, across and then down the wide valley. There is only one highway bisecting the valley, mountains bordering the east, and sagelands expanding to the west. At the base of the mountains lie a huge series of pale dunes, heaped up sand and dust accumulated there over millennia, blown there by the wind.
Snow began to fall and then it was dark.</description>

      <description>The big mountains rose quickly from the flat pi√±on plain below. Massive, snow-capped mountains, and a sixty mile wide valley broke the scale of distance I was used to. And the weird pi√±ons, with their twisted, old trunks, low tops, many branches: more like oaks than pine trees; held a strange presence. The plain itself savanna-like, with low grass and sagebrush, antelope, and slow-moving mule deer, who I would see in the mornings along the dry watercourses, under black cottonwoods.</description>

      <description>The spaces that aren‚Äôt worth anything. Where grass comes up between broken cement slabs.
The quiet places that no one goes.
Places that feel like they are yours, but you know they really belong to no one, and that‚Äôs why they are special.
Thoughts that many think, but don‚Äôt know how to talk about them.
Put-off ideas, made unimportant because they are frightening to confront.
Humble things.
.
We are surrounded by grass.</description>
