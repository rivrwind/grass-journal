            <description>The whole problem of existence
is that we are are like a river, but not
minds always flowing
restless, unable to stop.
Sit
by a river
with me.
See how the water
moves.
Touches
one thing, goes on.
Rest
in a deep pool, behind a log.
It’s cold, this water.
It will wake you up.
This river is you, and me.
The water is your mind.

<p>My first idea to write anything—<br />
anything written has already been wrote.<br />
What new ideas lie<br />
just outside the ideas I already have?<br />
The newness of the old, oldness of the new.<br />
Nothing is new or old<br />
designations told past, said in a certain way<br />
have no meaning.<br />
The running around of everything<br />
isn’t running.</p>
