                <p>For many, this is where the story of their life begins.</p>
<p>In such a room, when they had few things, life was charted to become larger, to include more. Maybe, though, there was a part of Steve Jobs that wished he had never left that room.</p>
<p>For me, this is where life begins, but also where it ends. I have thought carefully about what I want, and tried things. There is something so beautiful in this empty room to me. The beauty is a kind of space. There is space there. Space, like time, is interesting in that as I grow older I see that both space and time become rare commodities. Space to be.</p>
<p>This may seem like a counter-culture statement. But I would like to say this idea of space and simplicity is a place lived in on it&rsquo;s own. It is not against anything.</p>
<p>Never wanting more than that room is like choosing a fork in a trail<br>
that is narrower and also wider<br>
that has brought me somewhere<br>
both very old yet always new.<br>
It&rsquo;s less clear, this Way,<br>
It&rsquo;s very quiet though.<br>
And it has taught me to not have fear.<br>
There&rsquo;s a lot of space here,<br>
to garden in, to cook, to sleep and eat,<br>
to make mistakes.</p>
<p>So much of my work is about a single idea: losing sight of myself. Learning, re-learning to not think, and not do. Yet life we are told should be about building up a self—making it larger and larger, happier and happier.</p>
<p>I like to rest in a darkened room<br>
with a place to sit, music, and a cup of tea.</p>
