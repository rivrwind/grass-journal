            <div class="post-content">
                <p>A long time ago I wrote every day for a year. That blog was called Slow Gospel.</p>

<p>Slow Gospel offered a space where people could slow down, even for a moment.</p>

<p>The entries were brief, not longer than 500 words.</p>

<p>That was back in 2012. Things were already humming along pretty quickly back then in the big old world.</p>

<p>After a year I took the site down. It did not gain an audience as I hoped it would. So it lost meaning for me to write it.</p>

<p>At one point, I wanted to write longer things. I had an idea that writing longer meant I would eventually write a book.</p>

<p>I thought longer writing meant the writing was more sophisticated and meant more, even though I knew simplicity was actually complex, and multilayered, hitched to everything if done right.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect to turn aside from that route, and begin writing even shorter than before. Distilling experiences, thoughts, feelings down to a few lines.</p>

<p>And now I feel the urge to write shorter and shorter.</p>

<p>I want to think about people, not about problems. What are people attracted to? What gives a sense of relief?</p>

<p>Pounding down on the problems of the world creates more problems. It&rsquo;s like weeding. Remove a plant, and there is space for another. The weeds will never end.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll cook them for my meal.</p>
