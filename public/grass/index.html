About Grass Journal  &amp;nbsp;
I have always asked questions. For as long as I could articulate thoughts in words, I would ask questions that no one really knows the answers to—questions about death, meaning in life, about the universe. As I grew older, I worked very hard to not lose sight of these questions, even when everything else was telling me to focus on what was practical, answerable, and often fear-based."/>

<p>I have always asked questions. For as long as I could articulate thoughts in words, I would ask questions that no one really knows the answers to—questions about death, meaning in life, about the universe. As I grew older, I worked very hard to not lose sight of these questions, even when everything else was telling me to focus on what was practical, answerable, and often fear-based. I very deliberately chose, through my teenage and into my adult years, to keep this sense of curiosity vibrantly alive. You could say the result of who I am is this continuous curiosity. To me, there is always something more to ask.</p>

<p>Slowly, this curiosity became a source of creativity—a kind of energy I had to push boundaries, and always choose my own path. Even though it pained me to be a loner, never really fitting in, I felt it was the only way I could go forward, the true way, to myself.</p>

<p>My mom often tells a story from when I was very young. I tried asking her questions that I couldn&rsquo;t quite turn into words yet, and I would get so upset about it, I would give up. But something inside of myself never quite gave up on those questions. They receded for a time, but always came back when I had learned more. And now, I find the questions and answers have become what many call art. My art. The questions that come from being alive on earth.</p>

<p>What really matters? What is worth? Who am I? Questions so complicated and universal that they are cliché. Yet I think they matter. My answers are never final.</p>

<p>I heard it said once<br />
that a great truth is like a mountain<br />
that one walks continuously around.<br />
Throughout the day, the light changes, and<br />
every step shows something different.<br />
You can never see the whole mountain at once,<br />
but only in pieces, over time.<br />
And as time passes, quickly for us, the mountain remains.</p>

<p>I think of great truths at night<br />
when lack of light brings everything closer.<br />
I can&rsquo;t really see what is out there anymore.<br />
A great bulk, rising above everything.<br />
It has weight, but it makes no sound.<br />
It answers no questions, only remains
a single thing<br />
making, and unmaking<br />
everything.</p>
