      <description>This is my first idea to write anything—
anything written has already been wrote.
What new ideas lie
just outside the ideas I already have?
The newness of the old, oldness of the new.
Nothing is new or old
designations told past, said in a certain way
have no meaning.
The running around of everything
isn’t running</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Is there something you want badly?&amp;rdquo; he asked.
And she replied almost greedily, gasping for breath: &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;— and burst into a storm of weeping.
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; he asked.
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; she wept in despair.
&amp;ldquo;You needn&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of telling me, Sola dear. Maybe I can get it for you when I grow up.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t understand. You&amp;rsquo;re so little. No one understands. I don&amp;rsquo;t even understand it myself—day and night.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;  Sitting quietly,
doing nothing—
spring comes;
the grass grows
by itself.
&amp;nbsp;
What Grass Is  &amp;nbsp;
The spaces that aren’t worth anything. Where grass comes up between broken cement slabs.
The quiet places that no one goes.
Places that feel like they are yours, but you know they really belong to no one, and that’s why they are special.
Thoughts that many think, but don’t know how to talk about them.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;  Hudson Gardner writes, walks, codes, and reads.
He also enjoys doing nothing.</description>
