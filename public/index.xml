      <description>Close the eyes, and slip in
to that dark space.
A moment, then none.
No time.
I cannot explain.
Deep
in the pine woods
the water running by logs
and rafts
of flowers.
I come back, then go again.
A breath, or maybe more time passes.
In the dark: wavy changy patterns, like the bark
of Ponderosa.
The old trees dance so slow.
And the moons soft glow.
I can&amp;rsquo;t even see, anymore:</description>

      <description>All of the trails in this area are user maintained, and hard to follow. The safe way: find someone familiar, and go together The unsafe way: go alone — Directions to Lost Creek Chuang Tzu picked up the trail where it ended, and kept on going Li Po left behind a cup of steaming tea when he disappeared Tu Fu a branched bamboo shack, covered with old weeds, and a frog inside Lao Tzu left town by the most remote gate In the woods, where there are no paths.</description>

      <description>Things have been rough lately, or longly, for about two years now. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I wrote much about it, keeping difficulty to myself here and there, not wanting to bring anyone down, but now that I can see some kind of end, or at least some kind of change, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a few things down.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, over the last four or so years Anna and I have been mostly living in remote places, far away from friends, community, and support.</description>

      <description>For many, this is where the story of their life begins.
In such a room, when they had few things, life was charted to become larger, to include more. Maybe, though, there was a part of Steve Jobs that wished he had never left that room.
For me, this is where life begins, but also where it ends. I have thought carefully about what I want, and tried things. There is something so beautiful in this empty room to me.</description>

      <description>On the corner of Cerillos and Don Diego I saw a man working on his car as I crossed the street. He had the hood up and was talking with a friend. &amp;ldquo;Is that a carbeurator?&amp;rdquo; I asked as I walked up. &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s a carbeurator. Got the original clutch in it too man, like a hundred fifty thousand on it.&amp;rdquo; We talked about how much easier it was to work on carbuerated cars rather than fuel injection.</description>

      <description>Seasoned Wood
Working back and forth across the ground dragging logs to piles leaving them lay for a season, then splitting the logs, and laying them out.  ~~ By a river he lived for thirtyseven years cutting the meadow with a scythe in the hot June sun. Seasoning the land with his own sweat of work. Laying logs aside, for winter. Bucking and splitting, tucking things in. Then he died.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something funny—
So many times I&amp;rsquo;ve been told I can&amp;rsquo;t do what I want to do, by so many people, in so many ways. It happens almost every day. And then you might think to yourself, &amp;ldquo;well, I guess this guy is just really selfish, self-centered, and ignorant.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s not true either though, because I do listen: to how plants grow, to how animals live, to how people care and support one another.</description>

      <title>A Handbook For Ethical Instagram Use</title>

      <description>I started writing this out as a short post for Instagram.
I decided to put it there &amp;amp; here, because I wanted to write a little more about each point.
Ideas For Ethical Instagram Use 1. Consider why you are posting before you post 2. Do not attempt to make your life look enviable, or better than it is For some reason, this is almost the reason Instagram exists. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a harmful practice, and creates competition and instead of collaboration.</description>

      <description>A long time ago I wrote every day for a year. That blog was called Slow Gospel.
Slow Gospel offered a space where people could slow down, even for a moment.
The entries were brief, not longer than 500 words.
That was back in 2012. Things were already humming along pretty quickly back then in the big old world.
After a year I took the site down. It did not gain an audience as I hoped it would.</description>

      <description>Photo above by Demetria Provatas, me above the Hudson River in New York
I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that I feel my work over the last year, and maybe longer, has been dark. It&amp;rsquo;s been some dark times lately, for many people. And my own individual suffering was increased by a series of mistakes I made that resulted in an abusive situation I had a difficult time extracting myself from.
I&amp;rsquo;m not asking anyone to listen to the difficulties, as I have had several willing and loving friends and family members to listen.</description>

      <description>Happy April everyone, it&amp;rsquo;s the season of impatience and unpredictable weather. This is the first Grass Roundup of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve written or consumed this month. Read on for the fresh grass scent of new days and things.
Watching Firstly, a new channel by the Criterion Collection. If you&amp;rsquo;re not already an obscure film junky, you could easily become one. Before now, Criterion Collection films were only available on clunky, archaic DVD discs.</description>

      <title>Slaying The Instagram Beast</title>

      <description>In the last seven years, permit applications for entry into a certain wilderness region in Washington have risen dramatically. In 2011 about 2,800 applications were received. But in 2018 the entries had increased to over 21,500. A similar trend has occurred in other wilderness areas across the USA. Suddenly, the amount of people going to very particular, even remote places, has exploded.
There are probably many reasons why this has happened—there is a positive trend of people getting outdoors more.</description>

      <description>There was a gap in a leafy hedge
and I watched as a little bird flew in.
Spring rises
like a green mist, up from the ground.
Water is liquid, and comes back from where it was
like spring does.
Always something coming back from something
the beat of a stone, two thumps—
the old heart again.</description>

      <description>About twelve years ago, when I was 18, I wound up in college. I remember lots of things from those times, but I often remember hearing how awkward everything was. Maybe it was a buzzword back in those years. I just remember the word being appended to almost every sentence any of my peers uttered. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t that awkward,&amp;rdquo; they would say, about having to talk to a teacher after class.</description>

      <description>Shiso Water  1-2 Shiso Leaves 1” wide slice of lemon Boiling water  I like to make this water in the morning, before eating or drinking anything. Squeeze the lemon juice into a glass, add the leaves, and pour the water over. I’m not fully convinced about the idea of alkalizing the body through diet, however I feel like a sour drink early in the morning can relieve sugar cravings, and also improve digestion through stimulating the gallbladder.</description>

      <description>The whole problem of existence
is that we are are like a river, but not
minds always flowing
restless, unable to stop.
Sit
by a river
with me.
See how the water
moves.
Touches
one thing, goes on.
Rest
in a deep pool, behind a log.
It’s cold, this water.
It will wake you up.
This river is you, and me.
The water is your mind.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Is there something you want badly?&amp;rdquo; he asked.
And she replied almost greedily, gasping for breath: &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;— and burst into a storm of weeping.
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; he asked.
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; she wept in despair.
&amp;ldquo;You needn&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of telling me, Sola dear. Maybe I can get it for you when I grow up.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t understand. You&amp;rsquo;re so little. No one understands. I don&amp;rsquo;t even understand it myself—day and night.</description>

      <description>After leaving the retreat, I headed west and then south, across and then down the wide valley. There is only one highway bisecting the valley, mountains bordering the east, and sagelands expanding to the west. At the base of the mountains lie a huge series of pale dunes, heaped up sand and dust accumulated there over millennia, blown there by the wind.
Snow began to fall and then it was dark.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

Grass Journal is&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;a space of refreshing slowness.
A cool oasis of the internet.
I want you to spend some time here,
but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to.
The greatest asset is true freedom—
from fear, from hate, from having to do things
that don&amp;rsquo;t make any sense to you.
°
Sitting quietly,
doing nothing—
spring comes;
the grass greens, grows
by itself.

      <description>The big mountains rose quickly from the flat piñon plain below. Massive, snow-capped mountains, and a sixty mile wide valley broke the scale of distance I was used to. And the weird piñons, with their twisted, old trunks, low tops, many branches: more like oaks than pine trees; held a strange presence. The plain itself savanna-like, with low grass and sagebrush, antelope, and slow-moving mule deer, who I would see in the mornings along the dry watercourses, under black cottonwoods.</description>

      <description>The spaces that aren’t worth anything. Where grass comes up between broken cement slabs.
The quiet places that no one goes.
Places that feel like they are yours, but you know they really belong to no one, and that’s why they are special.
Thoughts that many think, but don’t know how to talk about them.
Put-off ideas, made unimportant because they are frightening to confront.
Humble things.
.
We are surrounded by grass.</description>
