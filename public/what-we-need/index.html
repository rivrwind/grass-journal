            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Do we have what we need? I sometimes wonder what I really need. Food, water, shelter, clothing, right? And yet, and yet as time has gone on it seems I have taken on more epicurean sorts of needs. Tea, sourdough bread, cookies with the tea, certain mugs and tents, other backpacking gear&hellip;</p>
<p>I wonder how long I could go without certain things, and if I would miss them or not?</p>
<p>One thing I miss is a sense of community. I think everyone is feeling that nowadays. Community doesn&rsquo;t really exist online. It has to involve inhabiting space with people.</p>
<p>I wonder how much we need, and how much we all miss, and if that will change as time goes on.</p>
<p>There is a theory that successive generations of people do not sense the loss of environments or animals because we are born into a world where there is a new baseline. So I guess it is also possible to say there are things that we <em>cannot know</em> that we miss.</p>
<p>Today I am listening to <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=bQAF2PPz4Ag&amp;feature=share">Erik Satie</a>. I took a few photos on a film camera from the 70s that I got off ebay last week</p>
<p>—The crank winds the film with a ratcheting sound. The exposure is shown on a needle in the small viewfinder. The leaf shutter clicks and the picture scene is imprinted—</p>
<p>Maybe film photography is something I missed. I notice that I am noticing even more—looking for those old angles and patterns of light. And yet the ability and desire to write also has not ceased. Maybe, if I can keep up both of these things up I will get to where I have always been going. Which looks like, to me, a greater awareness of being filled with whatever each moment has to offer. It may sound woozy or sentimental, but I&rsquo;ve found that even the feeling of warm pavement on my feet feels as good as almost anything else.</p>
<p><em>Where do you go?</em></p>
<p>Some end of a road<br>
In a dense thicket of blackberry brambles<br>
bursting sticky fruit scenting the hot summer air<br>
covering the black asphalt</p>
<p><em>Where do you go?</em><br>
Some end of the road<br>
The side trails, <em>you can still see</em><br>
<em>This</em> is <em>important.</em><br>
They lead under cedar boughs.</p>
<p><em>Where do you go?</em><br>
Under the gravel of the river beyond<br>
Are bones of the earth<br>
The beginning of another road</p>
<p>As always the end is a beginning<br>
Of infinite endings and beginnings<br>
Spreading out in all directions<br>
<em>Where do you go?</em><br>
And how do you know<br>
it is worth the going?</p>
<p>Waves under waves<br>
soothe the gravel into sand<br>
an estuary, a bog<br>
dipping clear water<br>
from a rainwater pond<br>
to drink for breakfast</p>
<p>Sunrise, sunset<br>
this is the beginning<br>
and end<br>
of this song.</p>
