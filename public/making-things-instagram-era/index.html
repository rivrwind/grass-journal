            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I got really burned out on photography a few years ago because I felt like posting photos online had become a game of trying to appease an algorithm that was based on making people addicted to staring at teabag sized images on their phones.</p>
<p>I felt lost in trying to fight to be seen when the content I make is not really popular or trendy. So I gave up, as I felt that the work and time I spent with that medium wasn&rsquo;t valuable anymore—people&rsquo;s focus and attention had shifted. There was and is a surplus of images to the point of saturation. And maybe I wasn&rsquo;t really taking all that interesting of photos anyway.</p>
<p>But now, I am finding my way back into taking photos again, but with a different purpose behind the work. As I can&rsquo;t find the energy to try and compete on social media for likes, views, and followers, I want to take the work back to the medium where it started, in print. The problem is, printing is expensive, and the audience, without a following, so small I can&rsquo;t imagine breaking even on a small book series.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve explored all avenues and done many of them, such as having lots of followers on Instagram, running a newsletter, blogging, running a kickstarter, getting grants and residencies, etc. The problem is, to get a lot of reach or success with all those things essentially requires two things: either you become your own agent of promotion with a stacked CV or a lot of followers, or you find an agent ie: pay someone to promote you. It&rsquo;s all mixed up with money and ego, which really have nothing to do with what I&rsquo;m trying to create and why—it might even be antithetical to the work itself. I&rsquo;m being idealistic, I realize, when I don&rsquo;t want to play all those games. But if a person doesn&rsquo;t compromise their vision, is it necessary that they have to settle for something different than those that do?</p>
<p>I guess it is.</p>
<p>But at the same time this doesn&rsquo;t really lead me into wanting to spend effort making things that no one will ever see.</p>
<p>I think that this last thought gets down to the root of the matter, which is &ldquo;why make anything?&rdquo; Discussing that, however, leads down a rabbit hole about ego and meaning and contribution. To keep it more simple, this is why I make things: I write and take pictures because I love to. And from past experience I feel people benefit when they encounter my work, or at least enjoy it.</p>
<p>So in order to continue in this way, it seems like I need to really give up on the idea that I will ever be canonized, famous, or important to anyone other than a small group of people.</p>
<p>Honestly, what a relief.</p>
<p>It would be nice to just keep living the life I have now, now that I think about it. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not so bad after all! Maybe I&rsquo;ll even start taking photos of things again.</p>
