            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I stood next to a fenceline and vacantly gazed at the mountains. Snow was falling in icy pellets. There were potholes in the road filled with light colored muddy water. The sides of the road were soft and lined with trash. There were piñon pine trees running up little hills of rocky dirt that were mud with all the rain that had fallen. I watched a small channel of red-brown water flooding through a field and under the road.</p>

<p>It was the middle of March and cold outside. There was woodsmoke still rising from houses and over the next few days wet, bright snow would fall and cover everything. I walked to the side of the road and watched ice pellets bounce off a metal fence. There were no posted signs but lots of old, twisted barbed wire. I walked on.</p>

<p>Amidst the narrow roads and trees of this area, the wind slowed and stopped. The oak trees still held gold-orange leaves from last fall. A river ran by under the road,  muddy and very swollen with snowmelt and rain. A three legged dog ran out from a fenced area, and I watched a plot of pale corn stalks move in the breeze as he barked viciously at me. Beyond them lay a small plot, maybe 100 feet long, that had been cultivated and planted. I looked at the dog, wondering if I should bend down and throw a rock. Usually dogs around here run at the first sign of a person bending for a rock. But some would rush up in packs of three or more. At those moments, I wondered about carrying pepper spray. This dog was all talk, and slowly cowered away as I bent down, giving sidelong glances as he limped away.</p>

<p>I walked past the little farm field, and chickens in a tin roofed coop mumbled at me. They all came to the edge of their fence, and stared in a group. For some reason there were three roosters. Then I walked out of sight and under a grove of oaks.</p>

<p>In a field I saw a horse. He was thin and followed me along the fenceline. His mane and fur and horsehair tail were all wet with the rain and snow. He looked cold but gentle. His flanks were bare, rubbed by the years. There was an open sore on his left flank. He looked broken down.</p>

<p>I saw a mailbox in the distance, one of the square metal ones with many slots for people in an area with lots of roads and no mailboxes. It was then I remembered the letter I had in my pocket. I took it out, and was about to slide it into the outgoing slot, when I saw it had been taped over. On the tape was written: &ldquo;No outgoing mail.&rdquo; I put the letter back in my pocket, and suddenly decided to walk all the way to the post office.</p>

<p>At the post office there was a line almost out the door. I stood in line, holding the letter in one hand after I had checked my empty PO Box. I didn&rsquo;t bother to check it every day. It was a long walk from where I lived to the post office. Most times it was empty when I checked. Sometimes there would be mail for someone else. One memorable time I opened the box and found a medical bill with an old mans name on it. I knew he was old because no one was called that anymore. Another time there was a reminder about an unpaid medical bill. And then a third time I found a collections notice. After that I didn&rsquo;t find any more mail for that person. Each time I had taken the bills and notices to the counter and said they were in the wrong box. The clerk said &ldquo;Hey how&rsquo;s it goin brother.&rdquo; And I asked him how he was. Then I handed over the bill and said it appeared in the wrong box. He nodded, smiled, and said &ldquo;Thank you brother.&rdquo; He had a very nice smile, and thick rimmed glasses, and dark thick hair, and skin the color of Saltillo tile.</p>

<p>The line was not moving, so I played a game. I counted how many zippers I could see. I got to fifty because it was winter. Then I was bored again. I just stared at the wall. There isn&rsquo;t anything to do when trying to post something here, at the post office. There is never anything new, except for some stamps that change sometimes. This one was so threadbare and behind, on account of the thousands of addresses belonging to the aforementioned metal square boxes, that they never had time to decorate. Much less have short lines. Or fix the potholes in the parking lot, which everyone  hated yet loved to talk about. There was really nothing to do but wait.</p>

<p>I looked at the letter in my hand. I had already forgotten most of what I&rsquo;d written. But it was sealed and stamped, so it was too late to write anything else, or erase part of what was in there. I figured I could always not send it. But then again, the two stamps would be almost a dollar lost. And besides, I had taken the liberty to draw a few sketches reminiscent of mountains on the envelope.</p>

<p>The line still wasn&rsquo;t moving. I couldn&rsquo;t see the counter, but there didn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone there, because no one was saying anything. Everyone was just waiting.</p>

<p>I remembered the cold horse in the field, and I at least felt glad to be indoors. Honestly, I wondered how much longer that horse would last. Could it generate enough heat to get through this terrible wet spring from just a meagre bunch of hay every few days? I really felt like it was being mistreated. For that matter, the dog too. The dog was always outside in whatever weather, and with only three legs. Maybe that&rsquo;s why he was both angry and sheepish.</p>

<p>I thought to myself how constant suffering brings on a sense of sheepish anger. I had felt that way before too. It&rsquo;s like a burning coal that never has quite enough heat to erupt. Maybe a few words tumble out, against this or that.</p>

<p>The others around me were growing agitated. I guess it had been about an hour. Finally, a few left, so the line moved forward. As I walked around the corner, I could see a sign on the counter. It said &ldquo;No Outgoing Mail&rdquo; and underneath was written &ldquo;For now.&rdquo; Well, maybe I didn&rsquo;t want to send this letter anyway. It did have two stamps because it was rather thick. It was addressed to someone I probably would never see again anyway. I put it back in my pocket, and walked out the door towards home.</p>
