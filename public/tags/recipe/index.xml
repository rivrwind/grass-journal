      <description>I have found this deceptively simple, vegan curry recipe to be just as delicious as one made with a masala. The individual flavors (garlic, ginger, cloves, cardamom) stand out more instead of getting lost in a cacophony of spices.
INGREDIENTS ‚Ä¢ 6 cloves
‚Ä¢ 8 cardamom pods
‚Ä¢ 1 tbsp Kashmiri chile powder, OR Korean chile powder OR whatever you have (optional)
‚Ä¢ 1 head garlic, peeled and ground to a paste, or finely chopped (Tip: shake cloves in a jar for 2 minutes or until skins loosen)</description>

      <description>In the morning I make tea. And lately I have been accompanying it with a single shortbread cookie.
For a long time I resisted making delicious cookies, because the problem of sugar. But I found if I make less delicious cookies, since they are less delicious, they don&amp;rsquo;t scratch the cookie itch very well, so I end up eating more of them‚Äîwhich pretty much defeats the purpose of making &amp;ldquo;more healthy&amp;rdquo; cookies.</description>

      <description>Shiso Water  1-2 Shiso Leaves 1‚Äù wide slice of lemon Boiling water  I like to make this water in the morning, before eating or drinking anything. Squeeze the lemon juice into a glass, add the leaves, and pour the water over. I‚Äôm not fully convinced about the idea of alkalizing the body through diet, however I feel like a sour drink early in the morning can relieve sugar cravings, and also improve digestion through stimulating the gallbladder.</description>
