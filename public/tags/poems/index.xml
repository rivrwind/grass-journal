      <description>Seasoned Wood
Working back and forth across the ground dragging logs to piles leaving them lay for a season, then splitting the logs, and laying them out.  ~~ By a river he lived for thirtyseven years cutting the meadow with a scythe in the hot June sun. Seasoning the land with his own sweat of work. Laying logs aside, for winter. Bucking and splitting, tucking things in. Then he died.</description>

My body, yours
the forest floor
body of earth.
High mountains
body of stone
left alone.
Rock cañon
and a sheep skull, full curl
that nobody claimed.
Calcium, schist to granite from magma
old cottonwood, sand
thirteen tracks of a roadrunner
disappearing into the body of a desert.
Sagebrush. Chimayo. Chamisa. Conejos
river running
under a bridge.
Bosqué, cottonwoods, los alamos
huge valley, snow body</description>

      <description>There was a gap in a leafy hedge
and I watched as a little bird flew in.
Spring rises
like a green mist, up from the ground.
Water is liquid, and comes back from where it was
like spring does.
Always something coming back from something
the beat of a stone, two thumps—
the old heart again.</description>
