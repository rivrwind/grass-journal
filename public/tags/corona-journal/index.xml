      <title>Anxiety &amp; The Present Moment</title>

      <description>Growing up, I was taught one of two reactions when things go wrong: either be filled with dread about the outcome, or get angry.
As time has gone on, I realized that I, like maybe almost everyone, am not good at dealing with anxiety in positive ways. I first became aware of this maybe 8 years ago, on my first cross-country drive alone, when nothing went wrong at all, yet I was filled with dread about what might go wrong for almost the entire trip.</description>

      <description>Today I wanted to share a few photos from the old times.
Back in those days when I lived in a place with a community of people around, and in a place that felt like home.
When rent was $250 a month, and I got all the free vegetables I ever wanted from the co-op where I worked.
When I used to have film cameras, and spend the days between work and college wandering alleys finding moments of beauty.</description>

      <description>I saw a man playing trumpet for an hour over background jazz music
I saw a woman juggling, and answering every question
I saw birds collect in the backyard, drinking water three times a day, arguing about who goes first
I saw a cat sleeping on a stack of pillows
I saw steam rise from morning tea
I saw ineffable feelings
I saw the color of roast hazelnuts when I took them out of the oven</description>

      <description>Music For You To Listen To While You Read
Walking across valleys
then down to rivers.
So much space to choose from
yet a tiny trail threads through the middle.
A distant mountain, thirty miles away
looks like it can be touched.
Walking toward it for three days
it only grows larger.
Standing on it, like an ant on a house.
Chipped bones from reindeer
lay beside granite rocks—
Twinflower blooming pinkly in dark clefts—</description>

      <description>Ten days of spring cold kept me indoors;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know willows were budding in the village.
In the frozen valley, a stream gurgles faintly;
sheets of green hide burnt stubble in the fields.
A few acres of poor land hold me here;
warming half a jug of cloudy wine, I wait for you.
A year ago today I crossed the mountain pass -
fine rain on plum flowers nearly broke my spirit.</description>

      <description>Walking in the dry forest
single note of a grey bird.
Peel up some bark
use it for a seat
lay down later same place to sleep.
Light rain in morning.
Wake under a log.
Open eyes to forest floor
scent of fresh mushrooms
growing from what has died.
Birds single song.
Walking through lodgepole.
Mind running like an endless river.
The morning and the day so near.
Evening so far away.</description>

      <description>Up in the high valleys of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, the snow has begun to melt. Patches of snow remain below the aspen groves, or on northern slopes. High up, around 9,500 feet, the snow is still deep. Near Agua Piedra (rock water) I found a closed trail headed up to a valley. We parked the truck down the road, and walked past closed summer cabins to the beginning. A creek ran quickly to the left.</description>

      <description>The red woven towel hangs limply from the oven.
I have already used it twice to dry my hands today.
The wind
outside
moves new leaves of bushes.
The ants have begun to build tunnels.
A metal shack
by the beat up street
has a padlock I have never tried to open.
The lock hangs from a handle that is rusting off.
The apricot tree nearby
has never been pruned.</description>

      <description>I have found this deceptively simple, vegan curry recipe to be just as delicious as one made with a masala. The individual flavors (garlic, ginger, cloves, cardamom) stand out more instead of getting lost in a cacophony of spices.
INGREDIENTS • 6 cloves
• 8 cardamom pods
• 1 tbsp Kashmiri chile powder, OR Korean chile powder OR whatever you have (optional)
• 1 head garlic, peeled and ground to a paste, or finely chopped (Tip: shake cloves in a jar for 2 minutes or until skins loosen)</description>

      <description>A few excerpts from The Abundance of Less  by Andy Couturier.
 &amp;ldquo;Maybe to someone else this would be terrible. But to me, I spent fifteen years traveling, and I was so satisfied doing that, when I came to this village I could live like this—&amp;rdquo; He looks around [at the barn he converted to a home] with a deeply contented and thankful expression—&amp;ldquo;I felt like I pulled off something terrific.</description>

      <description>Wide emptiness.
Spaceless nothingness.
Dust from millions of years
piled up high.
Mountains loom
but aren&amp;rsquo;t that steep.
Legs feel tired from hours of sand.
Spots of water in the dunes crooked cottonwoods
and an owl.
Fire of juniper twigs
above a dry pond.
All opens up
then closes in.
I walked so far
to get right here.
Dry creek bed
The night wind—
&amp;ldquo;come over&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;come over&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;come over&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Everyone on earth has had an argument with another person. During the argument, when emotions are high, it&amp;rsquo;s often really hard to recognize the other person as human. All kinds of bad words and names come to mind. Maybe not everyone feels this way during arguments, but I know that I have.
To ameliorate the impact of arguments, I came up with an idea of agreements, which I think I first encountered talking with my mom, when we were talking about a book called The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz.</description>

      <description>In the morning I make tea. And lately I have been accompanying it with a single shortbread cookie.
For a long time I resisted making delicious cookies, because the problem of sugar. But I found if I make less delicious cookies, since they are less delicious, they don&amp;rsquo;t scratch the cookie itch very well, so I end up eating more of them—which pretty much defeats the purpose of making &amp;ldquo;more healthy&amp;rdquo; cookies.</description>

      <description>I took a break from writing over the weekend—not because I had nothing to write, but because resting the writing bone seemed like a good idea. But now that I try to write again I feel like I lost the thread I had found. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s that nothing has changed from where I was on Friday.
Over the weekend I watched the lizards and birds outside in the sun. I made chaga tea over a twig stove from a chaga conk I found in Robert Frost&amp;rsquo;s old stomping grounds.</description>

      <description>Trackless trackless mountain cloud
what do I ask to be?
To be you, to be you.
Coming—going into nothing
what do I ask to see?
To see you, to see you.
Trackless trackless mountain path
where do I ask to go?
To find you, to find you.
Trackless trackless meadow of flowers
What do I ask of you?
To believe you.
To believe you.
 Does it ever feel, to you, like you are doing what you were made to do?</description>

      <description>I have been doing pushups lately. But my schedule is erratic. I rarely know when I will do a pushup. Sometimes I do them in the morning before I take my dogbone loop run through the dry neighborhoods. Sometimes at night just before bed. There are lots of times when I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do them, but I do them anyway.
As I write now I can hear birds outside in the chamisa, which is also called rabbitbrush.</description>

      <title>Corona Journal - Dishes</title>

      <description>Last night I washed the dishes left over from lunch. I washed them quickly at first, since washing dishes is such a boring task that has to be done every day. Long ago, it seems, I had determined that a chore like washing dishes held no real value, except in the clean dishes maybe—but in the act, the act of washing dishes there was nothing valuable.
To wash the dishes I turned on the water until it was warm.</description>
