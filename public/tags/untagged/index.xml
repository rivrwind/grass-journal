      <description>This is my first idea to write anything—
anything written has already been wrote.
What new ideas lie
just outside the ideas I already have?
The newness of the old, oldness of the new.
Nothing is new or old
designations told past, said in a certain way
have no meaning.
The running around of everything
isn’t running</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Is there something you want badly?&amp;rdquo; he asked.

&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; she wept in despair.
&amp;ldquo;You needn&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of telling me, Sola dear. Maybe I can get it for you when I grow up.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t understand. You&amp;rsquo;re so little. No one understands. I don&amp;rsquo;t even understand it myself—day and night.</description>
