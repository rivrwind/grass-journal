Maybe the important thing to remember about love is when it is held at a distance, examined, it may seem sentimental, cliché, impractical, useless, or mysterious.

But when love is experienced, it seems to be the only true reality, the only real choice one could make, or at least the best choice—it seems to clarify everything and fill the whole world.

That's all for today.
