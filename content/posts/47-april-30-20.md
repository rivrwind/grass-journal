I saw a man playing trumpet for an hour over background jazz music

I saw a woman juggling, and answering every question

I saw birds collect in the backyard, drinking water three times a day, arguing about who goes first

I saw a cat sleeping on a stack of pillows

I saw steam rise from morning tea

I saw ineffable feelings

I saw the color of roast hazelnuts when I took them out of the oven

I saw people turning inward

I saw people helping one another

I saw beyond the surface

I saw shadows in the dark

I saw light changing in the morning

I also saw the days growing longer

I saw photos of my friends farming

I saw people typing and working

I saw a man back hoeing in a dry river alone

I saw clear water flowing over yellowish rocks

I saw aspens turning green

I also saw myself in a mirror one day

I looked into my eyes

They were darker than I remembered

They reflected some light

and absorbed some light

and also let light in.
