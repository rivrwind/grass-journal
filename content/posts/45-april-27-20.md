Ten days of spring cold kept me indoors;   
I didn't know willows were budding in the village.  
In the frozen valley, a stream gurgles faintly;   
sheets of green hide burnt stubble in the fields.  
A few acres of poor land hold me here;   
warming half a jug of cloudy wine, I wait for you.  
A year ago today I crossed the mountain pass -   
fine rain on plum flowers nearly broke my spirit.
