Wide emptiness.  
Spaceless nothingness.  
Dust                 
from millions of years  
piled up high.  
Mountains loom  
but aren't that steep.  
Legs feel tired from hours of sand.  
Spots of water in the dunes    
crooked cottonwoods  
and an owl.  
Fire of juniper twigs  
above a dry pond.  
All opens up  
then closes in.  

I walked so far  
to get right here.  
Dry creek bed  
The night windâ€”  
"come over"  
"come over"  
"come over"

~~

A shadow moves  
sand plants  
blown by wind  
making circles  
in the sand.  
Or was it a hand  
that drew them?   
A shadow moves    
amidst the dunes  
Then merges into deep  
dune sand.
