Photo blog. I have a photo blog. The words surfaced slowly, like a lazily  
breaching whale.

I remembered my first photo blog  
It was called Lancaster County Photo Blog  
I styled it after one I found online called 
A Walk Through Durham Township  
Which was set in what seemed like a continuous Wyeth painting  
which was just someone's life  
Near Bethlehem, PA  
All the seasons—the snow, the ice  
The geese going, the open valleys  
The wide rivers of that area  
Her children playing  
The corn coming in  
Young farmers  
Who grew older as the years passed, but were still  
called Jakey  

The old coffeeshop on the corner  
Still there today—  
And all the old, rural ways.  
A proof of where she was, and the life she lived  
Every day.

No one cares about websites or photo blogs anymore  
They are old, like books, that no one  
has the patience  
to read.  
What is always next, there's always something  
better than what is now.  
But, I'm glad I can still take photos of twigs  
that matter to me.  
I guess I haven't really gone or gotten anywhere  
Since the Lancaster days  
When I told a woman I met from town  
That the country, in Southeast Nebraska, was beautiful  
but I could tell she didn't believe me.  
She had never really looked.
