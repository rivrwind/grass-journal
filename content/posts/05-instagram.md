In the last seven years, permit applications for entry into a certain wilderness region in Washington have risen dramatically. In 2011 about 2,800 applications were received. But in 2018 the entries had increased to over 21,500. A similar trend has occurred in other wilderness areas across the USA. Suddenly, the amount of people going to very particular, even remote places, has exploded.

There are probably many reasons why this has happened—there is a positive trend of people getting outdoors more. However, for certain key zones, it seems more is going on than random chance coupled with an increased interest in going outside.   

Many people have begun to point fingers at social media [influencers](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/24/vanlife-the-bohemian-social-media-movement) for the popularizing of places both wild and tamed. Influencers are essentially trendsetters with massive followings, sometimes hundreds of thousands of people. Over the last six years or so these influencers, particularly those who are #vanlife and outdoors based, began to drop into certain "most beautiful" places, and exploit them (in my opinion) for likes and follows, and even money (they are often sponsored)—by shooting nauseatingly beautiful, perfectly posed photos—photos so beautiful, that it's almost impossible for a viewer not to imagine themselves right there.

### Cyber Logging

These influencers nowadays would defend themselves to the end, mentioning that they practice leave no trace tagging principles (keep in mind: these principles didn't exist even two years ago), and that "bringing awareness" to places is always positive. People, while on social media, tend to see the world with rose-colored glasses. The only way something can be bad is if you choose to view it as such. Maybe this is because it's very difficult to see your impacts in the physical world when you spend so much time and thought interacting with the digital.

**I see this kind of exploitation of natural spaces for personal gain by brands and common people as the last frontier of environmental extraction.** It's a kind of digital clearcutting. Since landscapes have already been dammed, cut, and mined, the final frontier is the exploitation of their beauty for likes and shares.

About a month ago, I made comments on a variety of Instagram influencer accounts that I felt made posts of this exploitative nature. In particular, they had all recently geotagged the above mentioned wilderness area in Washington. My post was something like "Please stop using geotags in places like this for your personal instafame. They are being overrun by too much exposure." I got a variety of responses, most of them negative, with people lashing back at me for lashing out at them. I realized, and already knew, that insults were not a good way to go about educating people. I was angry, and had been for a long time, and it had finally boiled over. 

After reflecting for an afternoon, I realized I wasn't necessarily angry at those people for not examining their actions. I was angry at what Instagram has done to people, and at people's complicity.  

### The Beast

I think Instagram has become a beast. A subtle beast, that dotes and fawns, making me feel better, making me feel like it's necessary—that if I didn't have it, I would be missing out. And I think a lot of people have been entrapped by its honey'd barb.  

Over the last five years, I have often thought about deleting Instagram, but always stopped short. To me, it came down to the idea that without it, I wouldn't be able to keep in touch with certain people. Many of my friends post every day, and there is definite value in what they post: everything from their own creative work, to snapshots of their real life, to interesting things they want to share: things and thoughts I'd never otherwise see. But after my uncharacteristic and ridiculous burst of anger at random people, I realized that I'd had enough. For the time being, I was ready to let go of Instagram.

### Stepping Away

For the next three weeks, I didn't login to my personal Instagram account a single time. I was surprised: I didn't even miss it. Not checking my phone first thing in the morning allowed me a wealth of free time. It was like a burden had been lifted. The post making, the replying to comments, the reaping of follows and likes: it all ended abruptly. I didn't feel like I had lost anything. Instead, I had gained: time, attention, and sanity.   

In the following weeks, I began writing letters to friends, because without Instagram, I no longer knew what they were up to. I read two books, Americanah, and Independent People. I learned how to use Github, and coded the website you are reading this on by hand, a major advance in programming skills for me. I suddenly had so much more focus. I felt like a mist had been lifted from my eyes.

### Addiction
The fact is, the moment a person touches the Instagram button on their phone, they have initiated a system that harnesses the deepest, most vulnerable part of their brain: the rewards system. You may be familiar with dopamine, the neurotransmitter that is at the core of the system. Everything from the little white heart icons that pop up on a red background, to the way the feed is organized by complex and addictive algorithms, has been engineered by Instagram engineers to be as seductive as possible: to produce dopamine in people's brains.

I think seductive is a very important word here, because on the surface Instagram is so real (the content is from our friends) that it's hard to think of it as fake and bad. But in many ways, it is. But it's not bad like cigarettes. Instagram is far more skillful at making you addicted to it. It seduces you by making you think it's necessary, that without it you will be missing out. It leverages our needs for socializing, recognition, and stimulation, and turns them insatiable. Instagram is like water that quenches no thirst.

### Resisting Takes Effort

Maybe most people would say that they spend time every day doing things they don't want to be doing. In this case, I don't mean obligations, but habits. It might be easy to ignore everything I've said about Instagram so far, because it's easy to think that you are in control of what you're doing. However, anyone who has checked in even precursorily will know that is actually not true. For example, noticing the busy, somewhat uncontrollable nature of mind is one of the first insights of meditation practice. I would submit that Instagram, and maybe phone use in general, is one of those things that's hard to get clear on without close attention to habits. Are you using it, or vise versa?

I also think that resisting impulses takes effort.  My hypothesis: effort put towards, say, not checking Instagram— 

1. Erodes mental aptitude (distraction)
2. Increases stress (not satisfying an urge)
3. Reduces wellbeing (result of above factors)

I think these compounding factors may be why I had such a hard time focusing, reading books, etc when I was using Instagram. Every moment I was doing something "less interesting" (according to the dopamine-based rewards system) my mind would tell me to pick up my phone: there's something more stimulating there!

### Lacking Something

These thoughts so far have been drawn from my personal experience of using Instagram as a photographer and writer for about seven years. My experience has most likely been different than yours. For me, Instagram was initially a replacement for Flickr—a place to share my work. But I realized recently that Flickr was not only empurposed with the idea of sharing photos—it was about community and recognition too, at least for me. And online communities have often filled in for real-life communities that I've lacked.  

The lack of something is a powerful motivator. Feeling a hole, a space that was once filled and is now empty, can compel massive effort. Relationships with other people, for example, are often both the hardest and most rewarding things in our lives. They are hard because we need them for our wellbeing, yet they take effort. They are rewarding because effort deepens them.   

In my opinion, Instagram at its core is an illusory panderer of relationships. It makes one feel connected, while actually disconnecting people from the present and those around them. It makes one feel involved and accepted, but actually dis-involves, and perpetuates an insatiable need for recognition. Your mileage my vary, however, anecdotally, I have heard a lot of people echoing these same thoughts. But the way friends talk about it is more a vague uneasiness, like they are not really sure what to think of it. Their view of it sways from being terrible to wonderful. In other words, a relationship with Instagram for some can take on the hallmarks of an addiction. Something that is both loathed and loved, with obvious shortcomings, but that for some reason cannot be expelled.  

### How It All Began
Back when Instagram first launched, it was innocent enough. There were no sneaky algorithms, stories, geotags, suggested followers, ads (remember that?!), influencers... etc. It was a simple platform for sharing, used by creative people. The platform itself wasn't designed to be addictive. It wasn't based on fame and capitalism. It was a like a screwdriver. It was a simple tool.  

When Facebook acquired the company for $1,000,000,000 on April 9, 2012, everything changed. And now, six-ish years later, all the original founders of Instagram [have quit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/14/quitting-instagram-shes-one-millions-disillusioned-with-social-media-she-also-helped-create-it/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5bc33b1c3f3b), and some of the original employees have deleted their accounts. I think that's all I need to say about that.

### The End

I have now been off Instagram for over a month. Apart from my first day off the platform, I haven't received a single message saying that someone has missed my presence there. Coming from posting almost every day, for almost five years, it makes ya think... how much value was I really adding to people's lives? How much was I receiving? What could I have been doing with that time, and energy? In the time since signing off, as I mentioned before, it seems like I could have been doing a lot. Or, maybe, less. Just enjoying the present moment with a cup of tea, a good book, and occasional glances out the window.
