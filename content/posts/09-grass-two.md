I saw the wind blowing through grass around noon. The grass itself was moved by the wind. Still seeds on it from last fall when it turned gold. Last years grass. New grass also sprouting along the *acequia*, deep green grass in the empty yard behind it. The old grass from last year still waving in the wind, and sticking in the ground. It's these particular, year-old grass stalks that I like to use to floss my teeth. They are the perfect width and stiffness. Good for a natural floss, but also good for watching where the wind is blowing.
