I want to write about reading today. I want to convey the importance of it. Reading, in my opinion, is the closest thing there is to meditation. Let's define meditation while we're at it

> **Meditate â€” to think deeply or focus one's mind for a period of time, in silence or with the aid of chanting, for religious or spiritual purposes or as a method of relaxation.**

> **To think deeply or carefully about (something).**

In the case of reading, the aforementioned aid would be the text being read. Of everything I've done and experienced on earth, I think single minded focus is one of the most hard to come by (in the modern world) yet beneficial experiences a person can have. 

In 2007, an article came out in the New Yorker called **Twilight of the Books**
