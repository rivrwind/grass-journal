### Shiso Water

- 1-2 Shiso Leaves
- 1” wide slice of lemon
- Boiling water

I like to make this water in the morning, before eating or drinking anything. Squeeze the lemon juice into a glass, add the leaves, and pour the water over. I’m not fully convinced about the idea of alkalizing the body through diet, however I feel like a sour drink early in the morning can relieve sugar cravings, and also improve digestion through stimulating the gallbladder.

Shiso (紫蘇) is also called beefsteak (?? no idea why) or perilla. It is kind of like a Japanese basil, but it comes from China originally. It is known as being very nutritious. It is used in the pickling of ume plums, and lends a pink-red color to anything it touches when wet.

紫: purple
蘇: to be resurrected, revived, rehabilitated
