I've been putting a lot of effort into publishing a book I wrote.  The book is called "A Body of Water." (If you want to know more, you can read the query letter I am sending out at the end of this post). Once again, I am hitting a wall that I have hit many times. It doesn't really matter what the work is about, or how good it is as, much as the author's recognition.
