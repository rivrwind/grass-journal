Walking in the dry forest  
single note of a grey bird.  
Peel up some bark  
use it for a seat  
lay down later same place to sleep.  

Light rain in morning.  
Wake under a log.  
Open eyes to forest floor  
scent of fresh mushrooms  
growing from what has died.  

Birds single song.  
Walking through lodgepole.  
Mind running like an endless river.  
The morning and the day so near.  
Evening so far away.
