**Myth Time**

Rocks to soft moss after a day of rain.  
Sitting by the fire for hours.  
Walking into the meadow flat for more wood  
under dry spruce groves  
where nothing grows and needles fill the alcoves.  

Then laying for seven hours at night  
to hear barred owls fly across the lake, telling tall tales  
and land on an island in the lake, to raise their children...  

​		*"Once, long ago, all animals were people, and  
​		there were no people."*  

​		Back in myth time, as the owls grow larger with each word they say  
​		living still in myth time.  

Up 2000' to Lost Lake, and down to camp.  
Rain came again and stoking the fire  
to boil white fir for tea  
all day long.  
Mist like muslin clings to peaks.  
Blue steel cup, somewhat rusty, that Jacob uses to drink.

Piles of wood and stacks of branches our currency  
to transform to light and heat.  
The fire only thing that seemed real that day  
the rest of the world locked in mist, far away  
		*myth time.*

Hundreds of bats against the ink blue sky at night.  
Downpour and small lake formed   
under Teal & Jacob's tent.  
Cursing the high use of the area, but falling asleep easily  
to the rain, feeling warm  
wishing I was  
nowhere else.

Wake first in morning, like on special days.  
Watch orange mist make swirls and spiral into the air for an hour  
the light change on the lake, and listen to silence.  

Sun gets up and there is hope again.  
Two pikas squeak in a rockslide as I run up to a ridge coated in wildflowers, alone   
 but for four deer  
making their way  
down the trail—  
One buck with fuzzy antlers pauses, lets me watch him  
and parts the dew so I may pass.

At the ridge edge looking into another drainage  
I spy a hanging meadow of green grass and spruce  
—*just a little farther, maybe an hour around that cornice,  
then down into the cirque on rolly-polly rocks  
then up a small ridge—* and I'd be there  
a place where I could both live, and die.

But back down the the soaking trail  
to pick up my sweater off a stump  
then through a meadow filled with boulders and flowers  
to my friends and family  
and a long hike together   
back to where we began.
