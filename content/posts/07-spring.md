There was a gap in a leafy hedge  
and I watched as a little bird flew in.    
Spring rises   
like a green mist, up from the ground.  
Water is liquid, and comes back from where it was  
like spring does.  
Always something coming back from something  
the beat of a stone, two thumpsâ€”  
the old heart again.
