The whole problem of existence  
is that we are are like a river, but not  
minds always flowing   
restless, unable to stop.  

Sit  
by a river  
with me.  
See how the water  
moves.  
Touches  
one thing, goes on.  
Rest  
in a deep pool, behind a log.

Itâ€™s cold, this water.  
It will wake you up.  
This river is you, and me.  
The water is your mind.
