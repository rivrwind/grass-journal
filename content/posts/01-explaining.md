The whole problem of existence  
is that we are are like a river, but not   
minds always flowing   
restless, unable to stop.  

Sit  
by a river  
with me.  
See how the water  
moves.  
Touches  
one thing, goes on.  
Rest  
in a deep pool, behind a log. 

It’s cold, this water.  
It will wake you up.  
This river is you, and me.  
The water is your mind.

My first idea to write anything—  
anything written has already been wrote.  
What new ideas lie  
just outside the ideas I already have?  
The newness of the old, oldness of the new.  
Nothing is new or old  
designations told past, said in a certain way  
have no meaning.  
The running around of everything  
isn’t running.
