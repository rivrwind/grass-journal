*Photo: Anna off trail in the Jemez*

My body, yours  
the forest floor  
body of earth.  

High mountains  
body of stone  
left alone.  

Rock cañon  
and a sheep skull, full curl  
that nobody claimed.  

Calcium, schist to granite from magma  
old cottonwood, sand  
thirteen tracks of a roadrunner  
disappearing into the *body of a desert.*  
Sagebrush. Chimayo. Chamisa. Conejos  
river running   
under a bridge.  
Bosqué, cottonwoods, los alamos  
huge valley, snow body  
wide open, hot, steam from spring body—  
but cold that same night on our bodies.  

Walking again, up the same way  
but without a trail  
to where we hid our bikes.   
Riding in, then out  
along a body  
and in a body—  
Being somebody?  
Being nobody.
