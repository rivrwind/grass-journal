The red woven towel hangs limply from the oven.  
I have already used it twice to dry my hands today.  
The wind  
outside  
moves new leaves of bushes.  
The ants have begun to build tunnels.  
A metal shack  
by the beat up street  
has a padlock I have never tried to open.  
The lock hangs from a handle that is rusting off.  
The apricot tree nearby  
has never been pruned.  
Yet every year it produces new fruit.  
Cars still pass  
on Agua Fria street.  
The sun still rises 
and wakes me up.  
I feel confused about how I feel  
when each day is the same.  
This endless cycle of waking  
and sleep.
