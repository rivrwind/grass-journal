Yesterday I drove five minutes up a slow road to a dusty turnoff amidst piñons and rocks. There is no water in this spot, but heavy snowfall over winter has greened threads of grass between patches of sand and bare ground. Past the gate, an old road goes up a grade, like in so many places here, yet things grow so slowly the road could be fifty years old and remains clear. I wandered up then off the old road, and found even older ones under the trees, and sand filled arroyos, and older trails. I found tiny patches of willow that had been cropped to the very bottom by deer in winter. I was looking for a flat place to pitch a tent.

I found one under a grove of ponderosas, the ground covered with already tinder-dry pine needles. I set down a handful of sticks I had gathered, and put up my tent. I had no phone, or any electronic device, and there was only the occasional sound of the wind.

Once the tent was up, I sat in the shade of the vestibule and unfolded a small twig stove. I added dry, pencil-lead thin sticks to the stove, and then slid in some of the longer pieces I had found earlier. In a brief moment it was lit and burning without any smoke. I stood and wandered off between the trees.

Below older piñons were a few young saplings. They already had bright green tips on the end of each branch. The tips have a lemony, sweet scent. I asked permission to whatever it was that I could be grateful to, to the growth of the pine, to the land, to the snow and water, and the perfectly clean, crisp pine-needle air. Then I picked just three tips from each plant, and walked leisurely from sapling to sapling, until I had a handful. I raised the buds to my face and inhaled deeply.

Back at the tent I stoked the fire by pushing the long, dry sticks further into the box. Then I set a pot filled with water and the piñon tips atop the stove. As I sat, I opened up Mountains and Rivers Without End and read aloud the opening pages, to the robin I had seen   
sorting through needles with her sharp eyes, for bugs,  
to the first flowers I saw, yellow, being drunk by a serfid fly  
 to the pines themselves, if they felt vibrations of words  
to the rocks themselves, in their endless passages through time.

As the tea came to boil, I poured some into my waiting cup, and pushed the burning sticks further in. Gradually, the fire died, leaving behind feathery white ash that had no weight. I drank the tea slowly, reading aloud more of the book, and then,  finishing the first section, set it down. 

Slowly the time passed, and slowly the tea decreased, and slowly I came back into an awareness of things around me, inside me, and the in-between of inside and out, the mingling of the two.

As the sun shifted, the tree shadows lengthened, and I moved into the light. I took the hot ash and coals to the last remaining snow in sight and put them out, piling more snow on top, and mixing them into the snow. Then I smoothed it over, so no one could tell anything had happened there.

Back at the tent, I folded up my stove, un-staked, folded, and rolled the tent, and slid it all into my pack. I stood up, and looked around. I looked down at the ground, and the small bundle of sticks that remained, piled in a way that you could tell a person put them there. Where I stood was once a settlement of Anasazi (the ancient ones) who came before the Taos people, or maybe turned into the Taos people. Shards of pots still line an old creek, and once the land had been cleared. People had harvested the piñons when the chamisa turned yellow, and caught fish, hunted deer, and walked into the high mountains for aspen bark, and also drank tea, sitting beneath the pines… like me.

I walked away from the place where I had sat, made a fire, and borrowed what was freely offered. More than tea, clean air and sun was given. I was lucky to have a space made for it. A space within, that wants to be filled, that is taken from, put into, and then given away.
