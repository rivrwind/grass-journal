These buckwheat-oatmeal scones are surprisingly delicious. Buckwheat lends a cake-like texture and roasty flavor. Additions: toasted nuts, sesame seeds, or whatever you want. Recipe by [Anna](http://annakoenigart.com).

### DRY

**⁘ 2 cups** chosen flours (I used ¾ whole wheat, 1/4 buckwheat)  
 **⁘ 2 handfuls** of oats  
**⁘ 1/2 tsp** salt  
**⁘ 1 tsp** baking powder    
**⁘** Currants to taste (soak awhile in hot water)  
**⁘ 1 stick** cold butter (cut into dry ingredients)

### WET

**⁘ Large spoonful** of sourdough starter (dissolve in milk)  
**⁘ 1/2 cup** milk   
**⁘ 1 large** egg  
**⁘ 1/3 cup** sugar (or to taste)   
**⁘** zest of a lemon

## Method

Add wet ingredients to dry   
Mix til combined, but don’t overdo  (this helps keep the crumb cake-like—over stirring will toughen the dough)

Pat into fat disc and put wrapped in fridge for awhile  
Shape desired thickness  
Cut into squares / triangles / what have you  
Oven at 400+ until bottoms are browned
