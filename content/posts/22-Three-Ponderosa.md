Close the eyes, and slip in  
to that dark space.  
A moment, then none.  
No time.  
I cannot explain.  

Deep   
in the pine woods  
the water running by logs  
and rafts  
of flowers.  

I come back, then go again.  
A breath, or maybe more time passes.  

In the dark: wavy changy patterns, like the bark  
of Ponderosa.  
The old trees dance so slow.  
And the moons soft glow.   
I can't even *see*, anymore:  
who I am  
or how I'll be.
