This is my first idea to write anything—  
anything written has already been wrote.  
What new ideas lie  
just outside the ideas I already have?  
The newness of the old, oldness of the new.  
Nothing is new or old  
designations told past, said in a certain way  
have no meaning.  
The running around of everything  
isn’t running
