I have found this deceptively simple, vegan curry recipe to be just as delicious as one made with a masala. The individual flavors (garlic, ginger, cloves, cardamom) stand out more instead of getting lost in a cacophony of spices. 

## INGREDIENTS

**• 6** cloves  
**• 8** cardamom pods  
**• 1 tbsp** Kashmiri chile powder, OR Korean chile powder OR whatever you have (optional)  
**• 1** head garlic, peeled and ground to a paste, or finely chopped (**Tip:** shake cloves in a jar for 2 minutes or until skins loosen)  
**• 2.5 inches** of ginger root, ground to a paste or chopped finely   
**• ½** red or yellow onion, sliced thinly into half moons  
**• 1 can** (13.5 oz) unsweetened coconut milk   
**• ¼ cup** salty vegetable stock, OR **1 tbsp** miso paste diluted with **¼ cup** water  
**• 1 tbsp** lime juice, or **3 tbsp** tomato sauce/chopped tomatoes  
**•** neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable.  
**•** Salt

### VEGETABLE / MEAT OPTIONS

**• 3 large** carrots, cut into bite-sized pieces **OR**  
**• 3 medium** yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into bite sized pieces **OR**  
**•  1.5 lbs** Chicken (white or dark meat, preferably with skin) cut into bite sized pieces  

**Note:** you can also do a mix of the above, or even add **½ cup** frozen peas to the carrots and/or potatoes (which I like to do).

## METHOD

Dry roast cardamom and cloves in a large sauté pan over medium heat until fragrant and popping. Be careful not to brown them! Add enough oil cover the pan to 1cm, turn heat to medium-high, then add the garlic and ginger, frying for two minutes. Add the onions, and fry for one minute more with a good pinch of salt. Then add the vegetable/meat of your choice (if using frozen peas, add them after the coconut milk). Fry for another two minutes, then pour in the coconut milk and stock/miso and add the chile powder. Allow the sauce to simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low. Add lime juice or tomatoes, then simmer for about 12 minutes or until sauce has thickened, checking meat and/or vegetables for doneness. Adjust salt to taste, and serve with freshly cooked rice.
