I have been thinking a lot about sharing lately. 

When I was growing up, sharing was partly learned. It felt hard at first. It usually meant giving  away something that you wouldn't get back. It meant a comittment of a resource to some person or purpose. Like a juicebox at lunch, or a seat at a table. 

However, once a person learns to share, it feels good. At its root sharing is an inclusive act. Inclusivity feels better than exclusivity. Generosity has been proven to produce good feelings in giver and receiver.

There is an unlearned human need to share. Sharing begets connection, which creates and maintains relationships. And you can see the innate generosity of humans in how children always want to help.

If you look deep into the roots of things, you will realize that all wealth comes from the earth. The earth is the original sharer, or gift. Being born on earth, we are completely dependent on it. Just how a grizzly is dependent on salmon runs, so we are dependent on rainfall, snowmelt, soil, weather, trees… As society has expanded, and technology has grown, we are actually more dependent on the earth than before—though at first it seems opposite. The ways we are dependent on it have simply been confused and hidden.

I like to think I share because of that original impulse: of wanting to help.
