## Hudson Gardner
川風  

... is an artist. Relationships with plants, animals, and landscapes carry the same value to him as those with people. Deeply enmeshed with ecology, he spends a lot of time walking, biking, gardening, foraging, and otherwise being outside.

As of March 2019 he is finishing his first full-length  
book of writing — A Body of Water.

His writing and photos have been published by Patagonia, The Sun, American Public Media, Taproot Magazine, and more.

He has a BA in Eastern Religion with a minor in Psychology.

He enjoys the sacred act of doing nothing.
