## A modern ecological epic

**A Body of Water** is a book I wrote over four years. It includes photos taken over the last decade. The writing and photos follow a narrative arc through several watersheds and ten years of time as I search for home and meaning in life. It is a story about staying true to myself. You can read a longer explanation of the project [here](https://grassjournal.co/a-body-of-water/)
