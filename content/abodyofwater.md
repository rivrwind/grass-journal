## A modern ecological epic

**A Body of Water** is a book of poems I wrote over the last year. The writing follows a narrative arc through several watersheds and four years of time as I search for home and meaning in life. It is a story about staying true to myself. You can read a longer explanation of the project [here](https://grassjournal.co/a-body-of-water/)
