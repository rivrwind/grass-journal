# Grass Journal is...

...a space of refreshing slowness.

A cool oasis of the internet.

I want you to spend some time here,

but you don't have to.

The greatest asset is true freedom—

from fear, from hate, from having to do things

that don't make any sense to you.

°

Sitting quietly,

doing nothing—

spring comes;

the grass greens, grows

by itself.
